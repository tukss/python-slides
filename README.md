These are slides presented at the weekly meetings of the Python User Group at the School of Mathematics & Statistics of Newcastle University.

Many of the presentations are prepared as [Jupyter](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org) notebooks. You can edit them by opening the `.ipynb` file using `jupyter notebook file.ipynb`.
If you just want to see the slides either run `jupyter nbconvert --to slides --post serve intro.ipynb` or use the web-based service [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org). You need to give nbviewer the URL of the raw `.ipynb` file like [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/mas-gitlab.ncl.ac.uk/npe27/python-slides/raw/master/01-intro/intro.ipynb).
